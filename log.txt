#13: Split data into training and testing.
#14: Let's use RandomForestClassifier to predict default.
#15: Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
#18: Cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well.
#19: Use Grid Search to find the best hyperparameters.
